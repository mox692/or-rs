# or-rs

Provides an enum-like data, `Or` type, that can contain elements of N types. The Or type provided by this crate is primarily intended to be used with the `or_gen!` macro, but can also be used standalone as an extension of the regular Rust's enum.  

An implementation of enum exists in the enums module, which is automatically code-generated by `code_gen` crate. For more information on each `Or` type, please refer to the module documentation.
